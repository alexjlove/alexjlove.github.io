I am passionate about data science, machine learning, optimization, and artificial intelligence. I graduated from the University of Washington in June of 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and completed a three month Data Science Immersive course through General Assembly in Sydney. With a strong foundation in mathematics going in, GA equipped me with the skills in acquiring, cleaning, visualizing, and modeling data I need to truly contribute to the field of Data Science.

I am currently searching for a full time position in the technology, science, or engineering industries in the San Francisco Bay Area. I look forward to joining a dynamic data science team where I can nurture my skills, broaden my knowledge and create a positive impact in the industry.

I have served as the recruitment chair for my fraternity, Delta Chi, providing me with experience in leadership and interpersonal skills and have had extensive volunteer experience working with my local Rotary Club, school district, and parks department.
