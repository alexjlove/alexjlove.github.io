 I am passionate about data science, machine learning, optimization, and artificial intelligence. I graduated from the University of Washington in June of 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and completed a three month Data Science Immersive course through General Assembly in Sydney. With a strong foundation in mathematics going in, GA equipped me with the skills in acquiring, cleaning, visualizing, and modeling data I need to truly contribute to the field of Data Science.

 I am currently working as a Knowledge Engineer for Amazon Alexa developing the voice assistant's semantic understanding and knowledge graph. In this role, I am coming up with creative solutions to engage the user and delight our customers with new experiences every day.

 I have served as the recruitment chair for my fraternity, Delta Chi, providing me with experience in leadership and interpersonal skills and have had extensive volunteer experience working with my local Rotary Club, school district, and parks department.
