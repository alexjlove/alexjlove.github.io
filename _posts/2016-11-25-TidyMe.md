*Worked directly with the CTO of Sydneyâ€™s leading online platform for home cleaning services to develop efficient schedules for cleaners that minimized travel time and distance between jobs using shortest-path optimization algorithms and the Google Maps API. I also studied customer satisfaction and churn rates using Decision Trees with Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting, Logistic, and K-Nearest Neighbors models.*
